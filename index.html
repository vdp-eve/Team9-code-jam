              Hi! my name is  Terrence Shlomo Tegegne .Ilive in Quincy,
              Massachusetts .I am 28 years old ,and i work as a freelance UX designer.
              These days i am learning web development in hope to enter an adjacent
              field.
            </p>
            <p class="about__text">
              Let me tell you a little bit about my background. I was raised in a an area of greater Boston.
              Truth to be told i have made a few attempts to become a programmer and tried out
              different online courses and bootcamps but never succeeded. Then,
              I met Elise, a programming guru! . So now he's grown more serious
              about it and hopes to make it all the way through Practicum.
              However,if you insist on more truth from me, my motivation can be a little unstable and i often get
              distracted by my versatile other interests in life.
            </p>
            <p class="about__text">
              i have some hobbies which includes:
              Listens to a lot of podcasts on history & politics.
              Reading  sci-fi .
              I have a a TikTok blog of my pet goat!
              Volunteering at an animal shelter.
              Enjoy gardening - i am very much into calligraphy & embroidery (like tedious work and pay attention to details)
             
              Watching "Dragon Ball Z" with my nephews & nieces after school -I have a website dedicated to Dragon Ball Z!!
              
              Used to be a DJ
            </p>
            <p class="about__text">
              People know me as a party animal but actually
              i really enjoy some alone time in my garden or walking
              around graveyards . I am  adventurous and considers myself
              lucky. For example, i mined some Bitcoin in the early 2010s and
              that bought me a house a few years later.
